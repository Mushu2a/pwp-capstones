# CodeAcademy Capstones Project
## Language : *Python 3*

# Get Started
1. Git clone or download zip (if this, unzip when it's downloaded)
2. Open your command line and navigate to the TomeRater directory:
```cd TomeRater```
3. Run the file populate.py, using the command:
```python3 -i populate.py```
This file, populate.py, will create a TomeRater object called Tome_Rater 
and fill it with some users and books. The -i flag will leave the terminal 
open for you to play with. You can then run some of your methods you 
created in the last section by using syntax like:
```Tome_Rater.most_positive_user()```

### What we can do with this project:
```
- Create new User
- Create new Book (Fiction or Non-Fiction)
- Give book(s) to User
- TomeRater class do some analytics function and it's a controller of 
our other class (User, Book) we can now iterate with.
- And other cool stuff
```
